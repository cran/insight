\arguments{
\item{x}{A statistical model (can also be a data.frame, in which case the
second argument has to be a model).}

\item{...}{Other argument to be passed for instance to
\code{\link{get_predicted_ci}}.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame in which to look for variables with which
to predict. If omitted, the data used to fit the model is used.}

\item{predict}{Can be \code{"link"}, \code{"expectation"} (default), or
\code{"prediction"}. This modulates the scale of the output as well as the
type of certainty interval. More specifically, \code{"link"} gives an
output on the link-scale (for logistic models, that means the log-odds
scale) with a confidence interval (CI). \code{"expectation"} (default) also
returns confidence intervals, but this time the output is on the response
scale (for logistic models, that means probabilities). Finally,
\code{"predict"} also gives an output on the response scale, but this time
associated with a prediction interval (PI), which is larger than a
confidence interval (though it mostly make sense for linear models). Read
more about in the \strong{Details} section below. \code{"relation"} is
also accepted as a (deprecated) alias for \code{"expectation"}.}

\item{iterations}{For Bayesian models, this corresponds to the number of
posterior draws. If \code{NULL}, will return all the draws (one for each
iteration of the model). For frequentist models, if not \code{NULL}, will
generate bootstrapped draws, from which bootstrapped CIs will be computed.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings.}

\item{include_random}{If \code{TRUE} (default), include all random effects in
the prediction. If \code{FALSE}, don't take them into account. Can also be
a formula to specify which random effects to condition on when predicting
(passed to the \code{re.form} argument). If \code{include_random = TRUE}
and \code{newdata} is provided, make sure to include the random effect
variables in \code{newdata} as well.}

\item{include_smooth}{For General Additive Models (GAMs). If \code{FALSE},
will fix the value of the smooth to its average, so that the predictions
are not depending on it. (default), \code{mean()}, or
\code{bayestestR::map_estimate()}.}
}
\value{
The fitted values (i.e. predictions for the response). For Bayesian
  or bootstrapped models (when \code{iterations != NULL}), this will be a
  dataframe with all iterations as columns (observations are still rows).

Compute Model's Predictions.

\details{
The \code{predict} argument jointly modulates two separate concepts, the
\strong{scale} and the \strong{uncertainty interval}.

\subsection{Confidence Interval vs. Prediction Interval)}{
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Linear models} - \code{lm()}: For linear models, Prediction
  intervals (\code{predict = "prediction"}) show the range that likely
  contains the value of a new observation (in what range it is likely to
  fall), whereas confidence intervals (\code{predict = "expectation"} or
  \code{predict = "link"}) reflect the uncertainty around the estimated
  parameters (and gives the range of uncertainty of the regression line). In
  general, Prediction Intervals (PIs) account for both the uncertainty in the
  model's parameters, plus the random variation of the individual values.
  Thus, prediction intervals are always wider than confidence intervals.
  Moreover, prediction intervals will not necessarily become narrower as the
  sample size increases (as they do not reflect only the quality of the fit,
  but also the variability within the data).
  \item \strong{General Linear models} - \code{glm()}: For binomial models,
  prediction intervals are somewhat useless (for instance, for a binomial
  (bernoulli) model for which the dependent variable is a vector of 1s and
  0s, the prediction interval is... \code{[0, 1]}).
}}


\subsection{Link scale vs. Response scale}{
Having the output is on the scale of the response variable is arguably the
most convenient to understand and visualize the relationships. If on the
link-scale, no transformation is applied and the values are on the scale of
the model's predictors. For instance, for a logistic model, the response
scale corresponds to the predicted probabilities, whereas the link-scale
makes predictions of log-odds (probabilities on the logit scale).
